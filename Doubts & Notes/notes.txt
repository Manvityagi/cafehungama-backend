1. Notifications should be a column as an array in each of client, user & admin collection.

2. var Booking = new Booking;

// now you have to tell mongoose that the value has changed
    // because with Mixed types it's not done automatically...

Booking.slot_price_table.push([block1, block2]);
// now you have to tell mongoose that the value has changed
    // because with Mixed types it's not done automatically...
    Booking.markModified('slot_price_table');
Booking.save();
